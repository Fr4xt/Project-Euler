# Project-Euler
## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains my own solutions to the Project Euler problem archives. All solutions are made with the intent to challenge myself, and to further my understanding of mathematics and computer science. All code in this repository should therefore be thought of as no more than a personal collection of challenges, that I have chosen to make publicly available. All constructive criticism is therefore welcome, but judgmental/mean feedback will not be tolerated (and would frankly be pointless), as this project should be thought of nothing more than a learning experience.

Most solutions are written in Python, while others may be written in a more suited/convenient language if the given problem entails it. Some problems may have multiple solutions, if I for any reason want to explore multiple ways to go about a problem (i.e., using multiple languages to solve the same problem). 

## Naming
The solutions are named after the problem that they’re addressing, using the suffix “s” to denote solution, and writing the number in three digits to keep the naming scheme consistent. The solution to problem 1 would therefore be named “s001”. Should there be more than one solution to a problem, then these will be named using an alphabetical prefix. If there were to be two solutions to problem 1 then these would therefore be named “s001a” and “s001b” respectively.
